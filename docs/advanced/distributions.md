### Specification

In Trefle, the distribution zones for _plants_ are following the [World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions (WGSRPD)](https://www.tdwg.org/standards/wgsrpd/).

WGSRPD provides an agreed system of geographical units at approximately "country" level and upwards for use in recording plant distributions.

**The system offered covers the whole world and identifies units at four levels**, firstly continental, secondly regional (or subcontinental), thirdly at what may be called "Botanical Country" level (which may often ignore purely political considerations), and fourthly at a slightly lower level called "Basic Recording Units" where political integrity is fully recognised.

In many cases, where Botanical Countries have no complicating political factors, the units at Level-3 and Level-4 are identical. Very large countries, however, have been subdivided into more conveniently sized units according to constituent states or provinces. It is a fundamental principle that units at all levels are bounded either by political boundaries which appear on modern maps or by coast lines.

### List of zones

A complete list of zones is [available on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_codes_used_in_the_World_Geographical_Scheme_for_Recording_Plant_Distributions)

### Mapping zones to a map

Trefle does not provides coordinates for the species distribution zones yet. In the meantime, you can find GeoJSON files for each zones [on the TDWG Github repository](https://github.com/tdwg/wgsrpd/tree/master/geojson).
